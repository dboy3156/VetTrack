# VetTrack — Production Readiness Document

> **Purpose**: This document defines the objective pass/fail gate that must be cleared before any deployment of VetTrack to a live clinic environment. Any engineer or product owner can read it and determine independently whether VetTrack is ready to deploy.

## Hardening Changelog

### 2026-04-09
- **Security** — Removed `authHeaders` field from `PendingSync` (IndexedDB). Clerk JWTs are no longer persisted to IndexedDB. `sync-engine` now reads live auth headers at sync time via `getAuthHeaders()` and forwards `clientTimestamp` as `X-Client-Timestamp`.
- **Sync reliability** — `MAX_RETRIES` raised from 3 → 5. All `updatePendingSync` calls wrapped in `try/catch` so an IndexedDB failure cannot halt the sync queue.
- **API** — Shared `handleOptimisticMutation` helper introduced. `checkout` and `return` refactored to use it, eliminating duplicated try/catch/addPendingSync logic.
- **Performance** — `computeDashboardData` single-pass function added to `dashboard-utils.ts`. Dashboard now computes counts, critical items, user groups, location groups, cost estimates, and operational percent in one O(n) pass. `isEquipmentMissing` fixed to return `false` for checked-out equipment.

## 1. Pillar 1 — Stability

### 1.1 Uncaught Exception Rate (Frontend)

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | ≤ 0.5% of user sessions per 7-day rolling window trigger an uncaught exception |
| **Fail condition** | > 0.5% of sessions in any 7-day window |
| **Verification method** | Sentry Issues dashboard — filter by `level:error`, group by session; check the Sessions chart on the Sentry project page |
| **Prerequisite** | `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable must be set so `@sentry/react` is active |

### 1.2 API Error Rate (5xx Responses)

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | ≤ 0.2% of total API requests return a 5xx status code over any 24-hour window |
| **Fail condition** | > 0.2% of requests return 5xx in any 24-hour window |
| **Verification method** | Sentry backend performance dashboard — filter on `status_code:5xx` for the Express project; or query server access logs for 5xx count ÷ total request count |
| **Prerequisite** | `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable must be set so `@sentry/node` + `setupExpressErrorHandler` are active |

### 1.3 Crash-Free Session Rate

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | ≥ 99.5% of sessions are crash-free (i.e., no JavaScript fatal error causing the page to become unresponsive or show the Sentry error boundary fallback) |
| **Fail condition** | < 99.5% crash-free sessions over a 7-day window |
| **Verification method** | Sentry "Crash-Free Sessions" metric on the Releases page; cross-reference with `Sentry.ErrorBoundary` render events in Sentry Issues |

### 1.4 Offline Sync Failure Rate

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | ≤ 1% of queued offline actions permanently fail (reach `status: 'failed'` in the IndexedDB `pendingActions` store after the maximum retry limit) |
| **Fail condition** | > 1% of queued actions end in permanent failure across a 7-day field-test period |
| **Verification method** | Instrument `sync-engine.ts` to log permanent failures to Sentry with a custom tag `sync.failure`; run a field test simulating 100+ offline→online cycles; review Sentry custom event counts. Alternatively, inspect the IndexedDB store in browser DevTools after a controlled test session |

### 1.5 Push Notification Delivery Success Rate

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | ≥ 95% of attempted push notification sends complete without a `WebPushError` or network failure |
| **Fail condition** | < 95% delivery success rate (measured over a 48-hour active-use period with at least 50 send attempts) |
| **Verification method** | Add a Sentry breadcrumb / custom event in `server/lib/push.ts` on each send attempt and each failure; review the Sentry event rate. The 60-second in-memory deduplication window must not be counted as failures |

### 1.6 Service Worker Shell Integrity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | 100% of offline navigation attempts to any registered SPA route must resolve to the App Shell (`index.html`) — zero white screens, zero browser-generated "This site can't be reached" pages |
| **Fail condition** | Any navigation attempt while offline renders a blank white page, a raw browser error screen, or any response other than the rendered React application |
| **Verification method** | Manual test on a physical device or DevTools offline simulation: (1) load the app on a live network and navigate to `/equipment`, `/rooms`, and `/` to warm the SW cache; (2) enable Airplane Mode (or set DevTools Network to "Offline"); (3) navigate directly to `/rooms/<any-uuid>`, `/equipment/<any-uuid>`, and `/equipment` using the browser address bar; (4) confirm the VetTrack UI renders and displays cached or Dexie-sourced data instead of a white screen. Repeat on Chrome (Android) and Safari (iOS). The `vettrack-v5` cache key must be present in DevTools → Application → Cache Storage before the test |
| **Implementation reference** | `public/sw.js` — navigation handler fallback chain: `fetch()` → `cache.match("/index.html")` → `cache.match("/")` → inline branded offline page. `src/main.tsx` — `unhandledrejection` + `error` listeners with `recoverFromChunkError()` for ChunkLoadError recovery |

## 2. Pillar 2 — Performance

### 2.1 API Response Times

| Endpoint class | p50 threshold | p95 threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Read endpoints (GET /api/equipment, GET /api/folders, etc.) | ≤ 150 ms | ≤ 500 ms |
| Mutation endpoints (POST/PATCH /api/equipment, scan, checkout, return) | ≤ 300 ms | ≤ 800 ms |
| Analytics endpoint (GET /api/analytics) | ≤ 200 ms (cache HIT) / ≤ 800 ms (cache MISS) | ≤ 500 ms (HIT) / ≤ 1 500 ms (MISS) |
| Audit log endpoint (GET /api/audit-logs) | ≤ 300 ms | ≤ 800 ms |

**Fail condition**: Any endpoint exceeds the p95 threshold under a simulated concurrent load of 10 users.

**Verification method**: Run `artillery` or `k6` load test against the staging deployment with 10 virtual users for 5 minutes. Export response-time histograms and confirm p50/p95 fall within thresholds. Sentry Performance transaction traces can be used to identify slow spans.

### 2.2 Lighthouse Performance Score

| Surface | Pass threshold | Fail condition |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile (emulated) | ≥ 75 | < 75 |
| Desktop | ≥ 85 | < 85 |

**Verification method**: Run `lighthouse <production-url> --form-factor=mobile --output=json` and `--form-factor=desktop` via the Lighthouse CLI (or Chrome DevTools Lighthouse tab) three times each; use the median score. The test page must be the Home dashboard (authenticated session via Lighthouse custom auth if needed).

### 2.3 Time-to-Interactive (TTI) — Scan & Dashboard Pages

| Page | Pass threshold | Fail condition |
|---|---|---|
| Home / Dashboard (`/`) | ≤ 4 s on a simulated 4G mobile connection | > 4 s |
| Scan page (`/scan`) | ≤ 3 s on a simulated 4G mobile connection | > 3 s |

**Verification method**: Lighthouse TTI metric from the same runs described in §2.2. The scan page has a lower threshold because it is the most time-critical action in a clinical setting.

### 2.4 IndexedDB Sync Queue Flush Time Under Load

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | A queue of 50 pending offline actions flushes (all reach `status: 'synced'` or `status: 'failed'`) within 30 seconds of connectivity being restored, using the FIFO retry logic in `sync-engine.ts` |
| **Fail condition** | Queue does not fully resolve within 30 seconds OR more than 2 actions remain stuck indefinitely |
| **Verification method** | Manual test: while offline, perform 50 mutations (scans, status changes) via the app; restore connectivity; observe the sync indicator in the header; confirm the queue reaches 0 pending within 30 seconds using the browser DevTools IndexedDB viewer |

### 2.5 PDF Report Generation Time

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | A PDF report covering up to 200 equipment items generates and downloads within 8 seconds |
| **Fail condition** | Generation exceeds 8 seconds for a 200-item dataset |
| **Verification method** | Manual end-to-end test: seed the DB with 200 items, trigger the PDF export (QR print page or report download), measure wall-clock time from button click to browser download dialog using DevTools Network waterfall |

### 2.6 NFC-to-Overlay Latency

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | Time elapsed from NFC deep-link activation (`/rooms/:id?verify=true`) to the "NFC Room Reset" confirmation overlay becoming fully visible and interactive must be ≤ 1.5 seconds |
| **Fail condition** | Overlay appears > 1.5 s after the deep-link URL is processed, OR the overlay is missing the room name / item count (indicating the room query has not yet resolved) |
| **Verification method** | Physical NFC test on iOS and Android: (1) write `https://<production-url>/rooms/<room-uuid>?verify=true` to an NFC sticker using NFC Tools; (2) tap the sticker with the phone in an active session; (3) use a screen recording at 60 fps and measure frame delta from the moment the browser opens the URL to the first frame where the overlay backdrop and "Confirm Inventory" button are fully visible; (4) repeat 5 times per platform and record median latency. Acceptable substitute for physical NFC: navigate manually to the deep-link URL in the browser address bar and measure with `performance.now()` in DevTools Console — log the delta between `navigationStart` and when the overlay `open` state becomes `true` |
| **Implementation reference** | `src/pages/room-radar.tsx` — `useSearch()` reads `?verify=true`; `useEffect([nfcParam, id])` sets `nfcOverlayOpen(true)`; room data loaded via `useQuery` with `staleTime: 15_000` |

---

## 3. Pillar 3 — Data Reliability

### 3.1 Offline-to-Online Sync Correctness

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | After an offline→online sync cycle, 100% of queued actions are reflected in the database with no data loss and no duplicate records. The `last-write-wins` conflict resolution must not silently discard concurrent edits without a log entry |
| **Fail condition** | Any queued action is lost (not applied to the DB) OR any entity row is duplicated |
| **Verification method** | Controlled integration test: (1) record the DB state, (2) go offline, (3) perform 20 distinct mutations, (4) restore connectivity, (5) compare DB state against the expected delta. Use `psql` queries against the `vt_equipment` and `vt_scan_logs` tables to count and verify each expected record. Run this cycle 3 times |

### 3.2 Audit Log Completeness

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | 100% of the following action types produce a corresponding `vt_audit_logs` row: user login/provisioning, role change, equipment create/update/delete, scan, checkout, return, bulk-move, bulk-delete, folder create/update/delete, alert acknowledgment |
| **Fail condition** | Any covered action type produces zero audit log entries, or any audit log entry is missing the `performedBy`, `targetId`, `targetType`, or `timestamp` fields |
| **Verification method** | Integration test: trigger each action type once using a test user session; after each action, `SELECT * FROM vt_audit_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1` and confirm the row is present with all required fields populated. Run via `psql $DATABASE_URL` or the database query tool |

### 3.3 Soft-Delete Correctness

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | Soft-deleted equipment never appears in any list, search, or analytics query. All subsequent API operations on a soft-deleted entity ID return 404. No `vt_scan_logs` or `vt_transfer_logs` references are orphaned (their equipment row exists, even if soft-deleted, so foreign keys remain valid) |
| **Fail condition** | A soft-deleted item appears in any API response's `data` array, OR an operation on a deleted ID returns anything other than 404 |
| **Verification method** | Manual + automated test: (1) soft-delete an equipment item, (2) call `GET /api/equipment` and confirm the item is absent, (3) call `GET /api/equipment/:id` for the deleted ID and confirm 404, (4) attempt `POST /api/equipment/:id/scan` on the deleted ID and confirm 404, (5) query `SELECT * FROM vt_equipment WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL` and cross-check `vt_scan_logs` to confirm no orphaned FKs |

### 3.4 RBAC Enforcement (No Privilege Escalation Paths)

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | A Viewer-role session returns 403 on all Technician-or-above–gated endpoints. An unauthenticated request returns 401 on all protected endpoints. Passing a spoofed `role` header does not elevate access. Role is always resolved from the server-side DB record, never from a client-supplied header or body field |
| **Fail condition** | Any role-gated endpoint responds with 200 to a session below the required role threshold, OR a spoofed role header changes the outcome |
| **Verification method** | Automated integration test (Jest or `curl` script): (a) create a Viewer token, hit each Technician-gated POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoint — expect 403; (b) send unauthenticated requests to all `/api/*` protected routes — expect 401; (c) attach `X-Role: admin` header to a Viewer session — expect 403 on admin-only routes. See task `backend-rbac-enforcement.md` for the permissions matrix |

### 3.5 Database Backup and Restore Verification

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | A full PostgreSQL backup can be created and restored to a clean database in under 30 minutes with zero data loss. After restore, the application boots and all API health checks pass |
| **Fail condition** | Restore fails, takes > 30 minutes, or the restored database produces schema errors on application startup |
| **Verification method** | Perform `pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > vettrack_backup.sql`; provision a clean PostgreSQL instance; run `psql <new-db-url> < vettrack_backup.sql`; point the application's `DATABASE_URL` at the restored instance; run `npm run dev` and confirm `GET /api/equipment` returns 200 |

### 3.6 Multi-User Conflict Resolution

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | When two or more users trigger a "Verify All" (`POST /api/equipment/bulk-verify-room`) on the same room within the same second, the `vt_scan_logs` table must contain a distinct entry for **each** user's verification event — no entries may be silently dropped, overwritten, or merged. Each entry must carry the correct `userId`, `userEmail`, and `timestamp` of the individual who performed the action |
| **Fail condition** | Fewer audit/scan log rows are present than the number of concurrent verify calls made, OR any row's `userId` or `timestamp` does not match the corresponding request's authenticated identity and server time |
| **Verification method** | Controlled concurrency test: (1) assign two Technician accounts to a test session; (2) simultaneously trigger `POST /api/equipment/bulk-verify-room` with the same `roomId` from both accounts (use two browser tabs or two `curl` processes launched within 100 ms of each other); (3) immediately query `SELECT id, user_id, user_email, timestamp FROM vt_scan_logs WHERE note LIKE 'Room verified:%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20`; (4) confirm exactly two rows per equipment item are present — one per user — with distinct `user_id` values and timestamps within 1 second of each other. The `lastVerifiedById` on `vt_equipment` should reflect the last writer (last-write-wins is acceptable for the equipment row; the audit trail in `vt_scan_logs` must be complete) |
| **Implementation reference** | `server/routes/equipment.ts` — `POST /bulk-verify-room` runs inside a `db.transaction()` that writes one `vt_scan_logs` row per equipment item; the transaction does not use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so concurrent calls produce additive log rows |

---

## 4. Pillar 4 — UX Clarity

### 4.1 Empty State Coverage

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | Every list view in the application shows a non-blank, informative empty state (using the `EmptyState` component) when there is no data to display. Zero screens may show a blank white area where content would otherwise appear |
| **Fail condition** | Any of the following screens shows a blank or spinner-only view with no data and no empty state: Equipment List, Alerts, My Equipment, Folders, Users (admin), Audit Log (admin), Activity Feed, Analytics |
| **Verification method** | Manual walkthrough on a freshly seeded (minimal data) environment: navigate to each list view and temporarily filter to zero results or clear all data. Screenshot each screen and confirm the `EmptyState` component renders with icon + message + optional CTA |

### 4.2 Loading State Coverage

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | Every data-fetching view shows a skeleton loader or spinner while data is loading. Zero screens may show unrendered/blank layout during a fetch |
| **Fail condition** | Any screen renders a blank or partially structured layout for > 500 ms during the initial data fetch without a visible loading indicator |
| **Verification method** | Use Chrome DevTools Network throttling (set to "Slow 4G") and navigate to each major page. Confirm a loading skeleton or spinner is visible before data resolves. Record findings for: Home, Equipment List, Equipment Detail, Alerts, Analytics, Audit Log |

### 4.3 Actionable Error Messages

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | Zero raw stack traces, internal server error codes, or technical exception messages are shown to end users in the UI. Every error message shown to the user includes a plain-English description of what went wrong and, where possible, a suggested next action (retry, contact admin, etc.) |
| **Fail condition** | Any user-facing string contains a raw stack trace, an unhandled `[object Object]` render, or a message beginning with `Error:` followed by a technical detail |
| **Verification method** | Trigger known error conditions (network offline, invalid QR scan, unauthorized action, 5xx from server) and observe the UI response. Confirm: (a) the `GlobalServerErrorBanner` fires on 5xx and shows a human-readable message, (b) the `ErrorCard` component renders with a `retry` action, (c) the Sentry `ErrorBoundary` fallback page shows the "Report Issue" button, not a raw trace |

### 4.4 QR Scan Success Rate in Low-Light Clinic Conditions

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | ≥ 90% of QR scan attempts succeed on the first or second try in a simulated low-light environment (approx. 50 lux — comparable to a dimly lit procedure room) |
| **Fail condition** | < 90% first-or-second-attempt success rate in the low-light test, OR the scan UI provides no torch/flashlight toggle |
| **Verification method** | Physical field test: print 10 VetTrack QR codes at standard size (≥ 3 cm × 3 cm), attach to equipment in a room lit at ≤ 50 lux (measured with a light meter app). Use the app's scan page on a mid-range Android and a mid-range iOS device. Record attempt count per scan for 30 total scan attempts across both devices. Calculate success rate = (scans succeeding in ≤ 2 attempts) ÷ 30 |

### 4.5 Staff Onboarding Task Completion Without Assistance

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | ≥ 80% of new staff (no prior VetTrack training) can independently complete the three core onboarding tasks without asking for help: (1) scan a QR code, (2) check out a piece of equipment, (3) report an issue. Completion is measured from the moment they open the app to task done |
| **Fail condition** | < 80% of test participants complete all three tasks unassisted, OR average time-to-complete any single task exceeds 3 minutes |
| **Verification method** | Usability test with ≥ 5 participants (clinic staff unfamiliar with VetTrack). Provide a test device logged in as a Technician-role user. Observe task completion silently (no hints). The first-run onboarding walkthrough cards (implemented per `clinical-scan-ux-and-onboarding.md`) must be visible and must not have been previously dismissed |

### 4.6 Clinical Usability — Gloves and Stress Conditions

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pass threshold** | The "Move to Room" and "Verify All" interactive controls must each present a minimum touch target of 44 × 44 px (per Apple Human Interface Guidelines §Pointing devices and Apple/Android accessibility standards). No operationally critical button in the Equipment Detail and Room Radar views may fall below this threshold |
| **Fail condition** | Any of the following buttons renders a touch target smaller than 44 × 44 px at standard (1×) device pixel ratio: **Move** (Equipment Detail secondary row), **Verify All** (Room Radar), **Confirm Inventory** (NFC overlay CTA), **Return** / **In Use** (Equipment Detail primary row) |
| **Verification method** | (1) Inspect via Chrome DevTools → Elements: select each button element and confirm computed `height` and `width` (or `min-height` / `min-width`) meet ≥ 44 px. The `h-10` Tailwind class equals 40 px — any button using `h-10` must pair with sufficient padding so the accessible touch area reaches 44 px, or be upgraded to `h-11` (44 px) or `h-12` (48 px); (2) Physical usability test: have one participant don a standard pair of nitrile clinical gloves (size M) and perform the following on a mid-range Android phone: tap "Move", select a room, confirm; tap "Verify All", confirm. Both actions must succeed on the first tap attempt in ≥ 4 of 5 trials. Record pass/fail per action |
| **Implementation reference** | `src/pages/equipment-detail.tsx` — secondary action row (`grid-cols-3`, buttons `h-10`); `src/pages/room-radar.tsx` — Verify All button (`h-12`) and NFC overlay Confirm button (`h-12`). Minimum recommended class for clinical-glove use: `h-11` (44 px). `h-12` (48 px) preferred for primary actions |
